Read this article to setup conda https://github.com/fastai/fastai1/blob/master/README.md#conda-install

# Setup virtual env for fastai
conda update conda
conda create -y python=3.6 --name fastai-3.6
conda activate fastai-3.6
conda install -y conda
conda install -y pip setuptools
conda install -c pytorch -c fastai fastai=1.0.61


# Developer Install
The following instructions will result in a pip editable install, so that you can git pull at any time and your environment will automatically get the updates:

git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai1
cd fastai1
tools/run-after-git-clone
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Start the jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook


#Debugging installation issues from https://fastai1.fast.ai/troubleshoot.html
Tell me which environment modules are imported from:

import sys
print(sys.path)
Tell me which fastai library got loaded (we want to know the exact location)

import sys, fastai
print(sys.modules['fastai'])
At times a quick hack can be used to get your first notebook working and then sorting out the setup. Say you checked out fastai to /tmp/:

cd /tmp/
git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai1
cd fastai1
So now you know that your uninstalled fastai1 is located under /tmp/fastai1/. Next, put the following on the very top of your notebook:

import sys
sys.path.append("/tmp/fastai1")
import fastai
and it should just work. Now, go and sort out the rest of the installation, so that you donâ€™t need to do it for every notebook.
